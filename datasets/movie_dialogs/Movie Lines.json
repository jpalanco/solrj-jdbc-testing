You know how sometimes you just become this persona?  And you don't know how to quit?\nL869\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tLike my fear of wearing pastels?\nL868\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThe real you.\nL867\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhat good stuff?\nL866\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.\nL865\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...\nL864\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tMe.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.\nL863\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWhat crap?\nL862\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tdo you listen to this crap?\nL861\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tNo...\nL860\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tThen Guillermo says, If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210.\nL699\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou always been this selfish?\nL698\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBut\nL697\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThen that's all you had to say.\nL696\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWell, no...\nL695\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?\nL694\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI was?\nL693\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be occupied.\nL663\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tTons\nL662\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tHave fun tonight?\nL578\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI believe we share an art instructor\nL577\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou know Chastity?\nL576\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tLooks like things worked out tonight, huh?\nL575\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHi.\nL407\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWho knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.\nL406\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tSo that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?\nL405\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tLesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.\nL404\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tShe's not a...\nL403\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.\nL402\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.

As a gentleman\nL364\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?\nL363\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou got something on your mind?\nL281\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhere?\nL280\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThere.\nL277\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWell, there's someone I think might be --\nL276\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHow is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?\nL275\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tForget French.\nL274\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThat's because it's such a nice one.\nL273\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.\nL272\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tRight.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.\nL271\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tC'esc ma tete. This is my head\nL208\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tLet me see what I can do.\nL207\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tGosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...\nL206\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThat's a shame.\nL205\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tUnsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.\nL204\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWhy?\nL203\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tSeems like she could get a date easy enough...\nL202\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tThe thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.\nL201\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tCameron.\nL200\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNo, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---\nL199\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tForget it.\nL198\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?\nL197\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tOkay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?\nL196\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNot the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.\nL195\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWell, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.\nL194\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tCan we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.\nL953\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI did.\nL952\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tYou think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?\nL660\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tI don't have to be home 'til two.\nL659\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI have to be home in twenty minutes.\nL600\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tAll I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.\nL599\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tSometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?\nL598\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tBianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.\nL597\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tCombination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...\nL596\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tIs he oily or dry?\nL595\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHe practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.\nL580\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWould you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?\nL579\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tGreat\nL573\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tJoey.\nL572\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tWho?\nL571\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhere did he go?  He was just here.\nL51\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou might wanna think about it\nL50\tu3\tm0\tCHASTITY\tNo.\nL49\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tDid you change your hair?\nL760\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --\nL759\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tListen, I want to talk to you about the prom.\nL758\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tYou're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.\nL757\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHi, Joey.\nL756\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tHey, sweet cheeks.\nL593\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tMy agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.\nL592\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNeat...\nL591\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tIt's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.\nL590\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tQueen Harry?\nL589\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tSo yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig  that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.\nL397\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHopefully.\nL396\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tExactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?\nL395\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tExpensive?\nL394\tu4\tm0\tJOEY\tIt's more\nL1052\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tPerm?\nL1051\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tPatrick -- is that- a.\nL1022\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tIt's just you.\nL1021\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tIs that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?\nL1011\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNo! I just wanted\nL1010\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhat? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?\nL1009\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI just wanted --\nL1008\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tYou set me up.\nL1007\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tLet go!\nL983\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tSo did you\nL982\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou looked beautiful last night, you know.\nL914\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI guess I'll never know, will I?\nL913\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tNot all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.\nL912\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tGod, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself\nL911\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI guess I thought I was protecting you.\nL910\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.\nL909\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tThat's not\nL908\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNo. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.\nL907\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.\nL906\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhy didn't you tell me?\nL905\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tAfter that, I swore I'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --\nL904\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBut\nL903\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tJust once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.\nL902\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou did what?\nL901\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tHe said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.\nL900\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tAs in...\nL899\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tNow I do.  Back then, was a different story.\nL898\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBut you hate Joey\nL897\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tHe was, like, a total babe\nL896\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhy?\nL895\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tIn 9th.  For a month\nL894\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhat?\nL893\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tJoey never told you we went out, did he?\nL892\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.\nL891\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .\nL890\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tLike you care.\nL889\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tListen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.\nL656\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tYou're welcome.\nL655\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.\nL602\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.\nL601\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tBianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --\nL543\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tCan we go now?\nL542\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou are so completely unbalanced.\nL533\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.\nL532\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tIt's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?\nL531\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tLike I'm supposed to know what that even means.\nL530\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tAt least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.\nL529\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tCan't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?\nL527\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.\nL526\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhat's normal?\nL525\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tYou're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.\nL445\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.\nL444\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhat do you think?\nL443\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tOh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?\nL442\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tIt means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.\nL441\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tOh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?\nL320\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tCan you at least start wearing a bra?\nL319\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.\nL165\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNowhere... Hi, Daddy.\nL164\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhere've you been?\nL923\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tI have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.\nL922\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tI'm missing something.\nL884\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tFine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!\nL883\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tYou're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.\nL882\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tHe's not a hot rod.  Whatever that is.\nL881\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tIt's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?\nL880\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNo, but\nL879\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tThe prom?  Kat has a date?\nL878\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tDaddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --\nL546\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tBecause she'll scare them away.\nL545\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhy?\nL544\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tPromise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.\nL540\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tJust for a minute\nL539\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tDaddy, no!\nL538\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWear the belly before you go.\nL537\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tIt's just a party. Daddy.\nL536\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tOh, God.  It's starting.\nL524\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tIf Kat's not going, you're not going.\nL523\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tDaddy, people expect me to be there!\nL521\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tIt's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since Gloria Steinem over there isn't going --\nL520\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tOtherwise known as an orgy?\nL519\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tIf you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.\nL518\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tAnd where're you going?\nL517\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tDaddy, I --\nL190\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tExactly my point\nL189\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBut she doesn't want to date.\nL183\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tBut it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!\nL182\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tThen neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.\nL181\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tWhat if she never starts dating?\nL180\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tNo! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.\nL179\tu0\tm0\tBIANCA\tNow don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...\nL463\tu1\tm0\tBRUCE\tJust sent 'em through.\nL462\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tPadua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?\nL461\tu1\tm0\tBRUCE\tNever\nL460\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tFan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?\nL459\tu1\tm0\tBRUCE\tDidn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?\nL458\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tAlways a pleasure, Brucie.\nL779\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tBest case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.\nL778\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.\nL586\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tNo, I ' m not.\nL585\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tButtholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.\nL584\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThe hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?\nL583\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tExtremely unfortunate maneuver.\nL500\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tHell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -\nL499\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYou told me that part already.\nL433\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tIt's her favorite band.\nL432\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tAssail your ears for one night.\nL425\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tOkay!  I wasn't sure\nL424\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tHe's pretty!\nL419\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tDead at forty-one.\nL418\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tHer favorite uncle\nL417\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tIt's a lung cancer issue\nL416\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tNumber one.  She hates smokers\nL391\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tAre you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.\nL390\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWill Bogey get bent?\nL389\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tIn that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.\nL388\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThis is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.\nL245\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tLike we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.\nL244\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou got him involved?\nL225\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tHey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.\nL224\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI thought you hated those people.\nL223\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYou know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.\nL222\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThat's what I just said\nL221\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tDid she actually say she'd go out with you?\nL220\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tForget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?\nL219\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tI'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.\nL218\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThey always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?\nL217\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tNo kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...\nL216\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tHe seems like he thrives on danger\nL215\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tWhat makes you think he'll do it?\nL213\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYou wanna go out with him?\nL212\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tWhat about him?\nL211\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tUnlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?\nL210\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tI teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.\nL159\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tThe mewling, rampalian wretch herself.\nL158\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tThat's her?  Bianca's sister?\nL157\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.\nL147\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYou could consecrate with her, my friend.\nL146\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tYou mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?\nL145\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tGuess who just signed up for a tutor?\nL144\tu2\tm0\tCAMERON\tSure do ... my Mom's from Canada\nL143\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tYou know French?\nL142\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tJoey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.

My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.\nL333\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tYou're not a big talker, are you?\nL332\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tHi\nL331\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tI was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.\nL330\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tAre you following me?\nL328\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tSeven-thirty?\nL327\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tYou -- covered in my vomit.\nL326\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tCome on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...\nL325\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tAnd why would I do that?\nL324\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tThen say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.\nL323\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.\nL322\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tYou hate me don't you?\nL313\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tI know a lot more than that\nL312\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tLike where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?\nL311\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tThe night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.\nL310\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tOh, right.  Friday.\nL309\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tPick you up Friday, then\nL307\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tMy mission in life.\nL306\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tThere's a way to get a guy's attention.\nL305\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tSweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?\nL304\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tI mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?\nL1000\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tOh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.\nL999\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhen I go?\nL998\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tYou know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.\nL997\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tNo -- impressed.\nL996\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tWhat's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?\nL995\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tBianca did what?\nL994\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tThe part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.\nL993\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWhich parts?\nL992\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tParts of it.\nL991\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tSo tell me about this dance. Was it fun?\nL990\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tNo, Daddy.\nL989\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tI don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?\nL988\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tFunny.\nL987\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tYeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.\nL986\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWas that your sister?\nL347\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --\nL346\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tYou're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.\nL345\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tSo what I want doesn't matter?\nL344\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tAs a parent, that's my right\nL343\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tBecause you're making decisions for me.\nL342\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWhy can't we agree on this?\nL341\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI thought you were punishing me.\nL340\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tIs this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?\nL339\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tThen tell them I had a seizure.\nL338\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tMy insurance does not cover PMS\nL185\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tEnough!\nL184\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tThis from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?\nL174\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tYou decided.\nL173\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tI thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.\nL172\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI know.\nL1018\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tJust smack her now.\nL1017\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tAm I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?\nL109\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tNo ... I believe heinous bitch is the term used most often.\nL108\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tTempestuous?\nL107\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tThe point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...\nL106\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tI still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.\nL105\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tWell, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.\nL104\tu5\tm0\tKAT\tExpressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.\nL103\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tKatarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.\nL738\tu6\tm0\tMANDELLA\tYeah...\nL737\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tKat a fan, too?\nL736\tu6\tm0\tMANDELLA\tRight.\nL735\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tMacbeth, right?\nL733\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tOh yeah.\nL732\tu6\tm0\tMANDELLA\tYou think?\nL731\tu6\tm0\tMANDELLA\tYeah.  I guess.\nL730\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tCool pictures.  You a fan?\nL729\tu6\tm0\tMANDELLA\tHi.\nL728\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tHey there.  Tired of breathing?\nL777\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tMan -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.\nL776\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tSweet love, renew thy force!\nL775\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tYou were right. She's still pissed.\nL724\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tNo - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.\nL723\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tSo you got cozy with she who stings?\nL437\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tI'm likin' you guys better\nL436\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tI prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.\nL429\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tYeah.\nL428\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tEver been to Club Skunk?\nL421\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tJust for now.\nL420\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tAre you telling me I'm a -  non-smoker?\nL415\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tGood enough.\nL414\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWhat?!\nL384\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tWe're your guys.\nL383\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tYou two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?\nL382\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tPatrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.\nL381\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tSo Dorsey can get the girl?\nL380\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tThat's where we can help you.  With Kat.\nL379\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tDorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.\nL378\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tI think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.\nL377\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWhat is it with this chick?  She have three tits?\nL376\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tThe situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.\nL375\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWhat plan?\nL373\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWhatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.\nL372\tu7\tm0\tMICHAEL\tWhat?\nL371\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tSay it\nL512\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tSee you next week!\nL511\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tYou're completely demented.\nL264\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWell, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...\nL263\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tYou weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?\nL262\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tWhat's to discuss?\nL261\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tWhy don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?\nL259\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tI'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?\nL258\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tTouch of the flu.\nL257\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tI don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?\nL62\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tWith the teeth of your zipper?\nL61\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tIt was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.\nL60\tu8\tm0\tMISS PERKY\tIt says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.\nL59\tu9\tm0\tPATRICK\tI missed you.\nL933\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tThat ' s what I thought\nL932\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tAbsolutely not.\nL931\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tDid I have anything to say about it?\nL930\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tYour daughters went to the prom.\nL929\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWhat just happened?\nL927\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tBut -- who -- what --?\nL926\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tHave a great time, honey!\nL918\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tDr. Ruth?\nL917\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tWhat do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap\nL887\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tKissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.\nL886\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tThey'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.\nL877\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tPirate -- no question.\nL876\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tWould you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?\nL193\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tYou're not helping.\nL192\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tTumescent!\nL191\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tJesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?\nL171\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tSarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.\nL170\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tWhat's a synonym for throbbing?\nL162\tu11\tm0\tWALTER\tMake anyone cry today?\nL161\tu10\tm0\tSHARON\tIn the microwave.\nL2181\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tCan't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...\nL2180\tu23\tm1\tSAILOR\tWe left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.\nL2179\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tWe should have seen land.\nL2177\tu23\tm1\tSAILOR\tWe'll all go crazy...\nL2176\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tHe's the devil's child...\nL2175\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tWith a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?\nL2174\tu23\tm1\tSAILOR\tAh, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.\nL2173\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tWhat are you listening to, chicken ass?\nL2172\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tYou'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!\nL2171\tu23\tm1\tSAILOR\tThe water's going putrid in the barrels.\nL2170\tu12\tm1\tALONSO\tI never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!\nL2025\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tIF-GOD-WILLS-IT!\nL2024\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAsia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.\nL2023\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tBlind faith is what I consider heresy!\nL2022\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tDon't you realize your words could be considered heretical?\nL2020\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tDid He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?\nL2019\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tIf God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?\nL2016\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNo.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.\nL2015\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tIs that all that interests you? Gold?\nL2014\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tTrade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.\nL2012\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tIf they agree to follow me, yes.\nL2011\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tYour life, and that of others!\nL2010\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYour Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.\nL2006\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tExcellency, you are right.\nL2005\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tSenor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.\nL1993\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tThen you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.\nL1992\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI am, Your Eminence\nL1991\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tUnfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?\nL1990\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.\nL1989\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tYou say Asia can be found by sailing west?\nL2524\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tA waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.\nL2523\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tWhat a tragedy... what a waste of a life...\nL2522\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tYou can see for yourself.\nL2275\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tOn the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.\nL2274\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tIt won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.\nL2031\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tIndeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.\nL2030\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tHe is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?\nL2029\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tNaturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.\nL2028\tu13\tm1\tAROJAZ\tThe Judgment is ours!\nL2027\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tThe State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...\nL2540\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.\nL2539\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tWhat is it, now?  Tell me...\nL2538\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tI am busy inside.\nL2537\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tCan't you stay with us a little?\nL2474\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNot everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...\nL2473\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tThey took everything...\nL2472\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tThey tried... but I didn't let them.\nL2471\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tGod... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...\nL2320\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.\nL2319\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tYou don't usually ask.\nL2318\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tBeatrix, I want to ask you something.\nL2123\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tThat's something you can't decide.\nL2122\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI don't want you to wait for me.\nL2121\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tI'm not asking you to swear to anything.\nL2119\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tThank God...\nL2118\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tShe said yes.\nL1986\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tI find that hard to believe.\nL1985\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tPerhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...\nL1984\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tI'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!\nL1983\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAre we going to argue?\nL1982\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tWell... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...\nL1981\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI haven't given you much of a life.\nL1980\tu14\tm1\tBEATRIX\tI know.\nL1979\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI could be gone for years.\nL2432\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tI am afraid this is not the worst news.\nL2431\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHow could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.\nL2430\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tI am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.\nL2429\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHow far from here?\nL2426\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tCongratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.\nL2425\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tViceroy of the West Indies.\nL2424\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAppointment to what?\nL2423\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tMy letters of appointment.\nL2422\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYes... I remember...\nL2421\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tDon Alonso de Bobadilla.\nL2293\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tBartolome and Giacomo Colon.\nL2292\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tMay I ask by whom?\nL2291\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tForgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.\nL2290\tu15\tm1\tBOBADILLA\tI understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?\nL2552\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tTell me the first thing that comes to your mind.\nL2551\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tReally?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...\nL2550\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tI want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.\nL2549\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHe never had one... except aboard my ships!\nL2548\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tHe asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.\nL2547\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat does he say?\nL2542\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tI am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.\nL2541\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat are you listening to?\nL2501\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThere must be a passage to that other ocean.\nL2500\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tFather...\nL2485\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tNot bad.\nL2484\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHow are you feeling, Fernando?\nL2440\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tThis time with me!\nL2439\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI have to explore the mainland.\nL2131\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYes... Yes, I do... On all of them!\nL2130\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tDo you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?\nL2129\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tYou promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?\nL2128\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThere'll be a time.\nL2127\tu17\tm1\tFERNANDO\tI want to go with you!\nL2469\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAll of them created by people like me.\nL2468\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tRoofs... towers, palaces... spires...\nL2467\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat do you see?\nL2466\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tLook out of that window.\nL2465\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tI am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.\nL2464\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tCall them.\nL2463\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tAll I have to do is call the guards.\nL2301\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tTo rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.\nL2300\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat...?  Do I have so many already?\nL2299\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tYou seem to have a special talent for making friends.\nL2297\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tGood!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!\nL2296\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tDon Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.\nL2295\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tBut we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.\nL2287\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\t... for a commoner?\nL2286\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tYou defend yourself admirably...\nL2282\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tForgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?\nL2281\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThey don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...\nL2110\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tIf you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.\nL2109\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAnd were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?\nL2108\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tThen you are too ambitious.\nL2107\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI'm not bargaining!\nL2106\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tI remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.\nL2105\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!\nL2104\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tNo?\nL2103\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNo...\nL2410\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tYou never learned how to speak my language.\nL2409\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tUtapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.\nL2394\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tYou did the same to your God!\nL2393\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!\nL2343\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAsk him if he will help.\nL2342\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tHe understands.\nL2341\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWe will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?\nL2260\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHe has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.\nL2259\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tChief says...\nL2258\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\t... and also to bring medicine.\nL2257\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tChief says -- he has a God.\nL2256\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tTo bring the word of God.\nL2255\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tWhy?\nL2254\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThousands.\nL2253\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tChief says -- how many?\nL2251\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tTell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.\nL2250\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tChief knows.\nL2249\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tTell the Chief we thank him.\nL2248\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tYou come!  You speak first!\nL2239\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tIsland.  Far.\nL2238\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat is it?  A tribe?  An island?\nL2237\tu25\tm1\tUTAPAN\tSay not here!  Cuba!\nL2535\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!\nL2534\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tOh?  So you are a new man?\nL2533\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNew worlds create new people.\nL2532\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tI knew you would.\nL2531\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI have to disagree.\nL2526\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou'll always be older than me, Father.\nL2525\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tI suppose we're both old men now.\nL2145\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tGive me absolution.\nL2144\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tI believed in you...\nL2143\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou are bound by an oath, Father.\nL2142\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tMy son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.\nL2141\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tIf I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...\nL2140\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tMay God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!\nL2139\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI am not sure... It could be twice the distance.\nL2138\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tHow long?\nL2137\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.\nL2136\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tWhat are you saying?\nL2135\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tFather, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.\nL2134\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tI am listening, my son.\nL2133\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tForgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.\nL2132\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tIn Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.\nL2046\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tColon!  Don't!\nL2045\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAll of them!  Just lies!\nL2042\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tDamn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!\nL2041\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tColon!\nL2040\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tDamn God!\nL2039\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tIf God intends you to go, then you will go.\nL2038\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?\nL2037\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tYou mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.\nL1969\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tOnly God knows the meaning of such words, my son.\nL1968\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!\nL1967\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tYou get so carried away when you are being contradicted!\nL1966\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tPassion is something one cannot control!\nL1965\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tFather Marchena!\nL1964\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI'll try to remember that, Marchena...\nL1963\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tTwo minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.\nL1962\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tSo was Christ!\nL1961\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tEsdras is a Jew.\nL1960\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThe calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...\nL1959\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tHow can you be so certain?\nL1958\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tIgnorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.\nL1957\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tHow can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.\nL1952\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tTo open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...\nL1951\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tWhy do you wish to sail west?\nL1950\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tWith some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.\nL1949\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHow did you manage it?\nL1948\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tThat's what it says.\nL1947\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tGod... That's in a week!\nL1943\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tFather, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.\nL1942\tu19\tm1\tMARCHENA\tDiego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...\nL2459\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYour Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.\nL2458\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tThere is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?\nL2457\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThank you.\nL2456\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tBut without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.\nL2280\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThey come and go as naked as the day God created them...\nL2279\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tDo they have such thoughts?\nL2086\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?\nL2085\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tHow old are you, Senor Colon?\nL2082\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tA woman?\nL2081\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tI know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... What if?...\nL2080\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tYou show no inclination to speak otherwise!\nL2079\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tMay I speak freely?\nL2077\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tSurely you can do anything you want.\nL2076\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tI cannot ignore the verdict of my council.\nL2075\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tThat she was impregnable.\nL2074\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat did they say about Granada before today?\nL2073\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tThe ocean is uncrossable?\nL2072\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tNo more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.\nL2071\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tI should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.\nL2389\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tYou will regret this.\nL2388\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?\nL2387\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tSavagery is what monkeys understand.\nL2386\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tIn one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!\nL2348\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tYou did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.\nL2347\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tDon Moxica -- we all have to work.\nL2346\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tMy horse doesn't work.\nL2345\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWe can't raise the wheel without it.\nL2333\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWe came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.\nL2332\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tWe don't need to know.\nL2331\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?\nL2329\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tIf you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.\nL2328\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tWe lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.\nL2278\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThe Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.\nL2277\tu21\tm1\tMOXICA\tAnd you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.\nL2492\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tWe can't be.\nL2491\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tHe's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.\nL2490\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tWhat's he doing?\nL2165\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tTwenty eight.\nL2164\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhat do you read?\nL2160\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tCome over here.\nL2159\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tWell, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.\nL2158\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAnd what do you think Mendez?\nL2157\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tWell... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...\nL2155\tu20\tm1\tMENDEZ\tGod be with us admiral.\nL2154\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tDue west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...\nL2211\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou're right.  Let the men decide.\nL2210\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tYou tell that to them!\nL2209\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tPinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!\nL2208\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tYou bloody...\nL2207\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?\nL2206\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tJesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!\nL2205\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tAnd then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!\nL2204\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tYou don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!\nL2203\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tThe land is there.  I know it!\nL2202\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tWe're lost!\nL2201\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tYou think I don't know that?\nL2200\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tWe're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!\nL2199\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWe have to keep the hopes of these men alive!\nL2198\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tYou must be mad...!\nL2197\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tSix days ago, yes.\nL2196\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tYou lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!\nL2065\tu22\tm1\tPINZON\tImmediately.\nL2064\tu16\tm1\tCOLUMBUS\tWhere can I meet this man?\nL2462\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tBecause he is not afraid of me.\nL2461\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tThen why?\nL2460\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tI know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.\nL2419\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tAnd who would you think of, for such a task?\nL2418\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tHe must be replaced.\nL2417\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tThen, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?\nL2415\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tIs this true, Brother Buyl?\nL2414\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\t... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...\nL2377\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tWe weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.\nL2376\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tEvery ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.\nL2116\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tYes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!\nL2115\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\t... Into a monk...\nL2113\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tNever, Your Majesty.  Although...\nL2112\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tYou were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.\nL1931\tu24\tm1\tSANCHEZ\tYes, Your Majesty.\nL1930\tu18\tm1\tISABEL\tIs that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?\nL3546\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tOfficers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!\nL3545\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\t...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...\nL3497\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.\nL3496\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tI'm abused.  Don't you think?\nL3493\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tCan I see your back?\nL3492\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tOut on my back when I was a small boy.\nL3491\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tYour father put cigarettes out on you?\nL3490\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tThat's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.\nL3489\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tYeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?\nL3488\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tYour father blamed you for your mother's blindness?\nL3487\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tYeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...\nL3486\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tBack in the Czech Republic?\nL3485\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tYeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.\nL3484\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tYour mother was blind?\nL3483\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tMy father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.\nL3482\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tTell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.\nL3481\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tGive me another one, please.\nL3480\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.\nL3479\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tWhat else do you need?\nL3478\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tThis is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.\nL3477\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tThirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.\nL3476\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tBut it's...\nL3475\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tNo.  No way.\nL3474\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI would say...half.  Half is fair.\nL3473\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tWhat's your cut?  How much?\nL3472\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tLook, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.\nL3471\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tWhat about my movie rights?  Book rights?\nL3470\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tDon't worry about him.  Think about yourself.\nL3469\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tNo, he is here.  Shit...\nL3468\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tDisappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.\nL3467\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tWhat about Oleg?\nL3466\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tWell, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.\nL3465\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tI was all of these.\nL3464\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\t...delusions and paranoia.\nL3461\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tOh, sure.\nL3460\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tYou bring the cigarettes?\nL3459\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.\nL3396\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.\nL3395\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tYes.  Yes, come with me!\nL3394\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI'm coming with you.\nL3393\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tWhere are we going?\nL3392\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tDon't say anything.\nL3385\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tHe has the camera!  He took the movie!\nL3384\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tEmil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?\nL3383\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tOh no!  No!  Shit!\nL3382\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tHere.  I have your money.\nL3381\tu26\tm2\tCUTLER\tI'm not your lawyer until I see the money.\nL3380\tu30\tm2\tEMIL\tAre you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.\nL3517\tu34\tm2\tJORDY\tDaphne, I...\nL3516\tu27\tm2\tDAPHNE\tI don't want to drag you down with me.\nL3515\tu34\tm2\tJORDY\t...Do you really want me to forget about you?\nL3514\tu27\tm2\tDAPHNE\tForget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.\nL3330\tu27\tm2\tDAPHNE\tPouring it out!\nL3329\tu34\tm2\tJORDY\tWhat are you doing?\nL3318\tu27\tm2\tDAPHNE\tI'll get my clothes.\nL3317\tu34\tm2\tJORDY\tI'll make some for us.\nL3316\tu27\tm2\tDAPHNE\tIn the kitchen.\nL3315\tu34\tm2\tJORDY\tDo you have coffee?\n","comment":"","msgTable":[[{"key":"characterID","value":"L1045"},{"key":"characterID","value":"u0"},{"key":"characterID","value":"m0"},{"key":"characterID","value":"BIANCA"},{"key":"characterID","value":"They do not!"}],[{"key":"movieID","value":"L1044"},{"key":"movieID","value":"u2"},{"key":"movieID","value":"m0"},{"key":"movieID","value":"CAMERON"},{"key":"movieID","value":"They do to!"}],[{"key":"character_name","value":"L985"},{"key":"character_name","value":"u0"},{"key":"character_name","value":"m0"},{"key":"character_name","value":"BIANCA"},{"key":"character_name","value":"I hope so."}],[{"key":"line","value":"L984"},{"key":"line","value":"u2"},{"key":"line","value":"m0"},{"key":"line","value":"CAMERON"},{"key":"line","value":"She okay?"}],[{"value":"L925"},{"value":"u0"},{"value":"m0"},{"value":"BIANCA"},{"value":"Let's go."}],[{"value":"L924"},{"value":"u2"},{"value":"m0"},{"value":"CAMERON"},{"value":"Wow"}],[{"value":"L872"},{"value":"u0"},{"value":"m0"},{"value":"BIANCA"},{"value":"Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie."}],[{"value":"L871"},{"value":"u2"},{"value":"m0"},{"value":"CAMERON"},{"value":"No"}],[{"value":"L870"},{"value":"u0"},{"value":"m0"},{"value":"BIANCA"},{"value":"I'm kidding.
